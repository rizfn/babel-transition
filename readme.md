# The Babel Transition

This project aims to make a simple model to explore the dynamical behaviour of the possibility that language evolves as a means of **dis**communication.

## Project structure

- `src` contains the source code for simulations
- `docs` contains presentations and interactive visualizations


### The origin of this study

Given my previous work on soil and a conversation about acorn mast years at the Biocomplexity common room, I thought about chemical signalling in soil. Microbes (which are abundant in soil) are known to communicate through secreting chemicals, a process called Quorum sensing. Plants are also hypothesized to communicate through their roots. 

I talked to Kuni about how I believed in the possibility of a *cryptographical arms race* inside soil: where there was useful information ("there's water over there!") that needs to be communicated to your own species, but not to others as they could steal the information. Perhaps, in the same way that the co-evolution of phage-bacteria systems is an ever-evolving arms race, we have some sort of "chemical cryptography" in action, as a self-organized cryptographical system of increasing complexity.

Kuni smiled, and told me he had thought of something similar. While it's intuitive to imagine language as an evolved tool in order to communicate easily, it doesn't explain two things. One, the complexity of language, and two, the diversity in the number of languages. Thus, he was curious about the hypothesis that language has evolved as a means of discommunication, for similar reasons as above. 

"That's a crazy idea,", I said. "Will anyone even publish it?". Kuni's response was simple:

> The sort of papers that no one wants to publish because they're too crazy are typically the best kind of papers.
