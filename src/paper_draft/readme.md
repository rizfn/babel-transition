### The Paper Stuff

Here's where most of the figures used in the paper came from!

There were too many models, so most things here are relevant to the final results.

- [`1D`](./1D/) contains the 1-dimensional model
- [`2D`](./2D/), likewise, has the 2-dimensional model
- [`latticeAnimNewCluster`](./latticeAnimNewCluster/) has the animation and frames (snapshots) to show how a new cluster grows and evolves (on the boundary) for the 2D model.
- [`meanfied`](./meanfield/) has the mean-field (densely connected) model.
- [`server`](./server/) contains plots (again, for the 2D model) generated on the server.
